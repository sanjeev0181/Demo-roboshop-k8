Service is a method for exposing a network application that is running as one or more 
pods in your cluster.

Service types
Cluster ip :- internal to k8 cluter 
              only work pod to pod communication

NodePort: Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort).
          To make the node port available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address, 
          the same as if you had requested a Service of type: ClusterIP.
LoadBalancer: Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.
ExternalName: Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), 
              by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up.


--service-node-port-range flag (default: 30000-32767).
